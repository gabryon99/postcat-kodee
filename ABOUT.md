## About

Welcome to **PostCat Kodee**!
This mobile game is a simple endless runner written
of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and brought to life on the open-source
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine.

### Technology

If you're curious about the underlying technology, we're powered by
the [Godot Kotlin/JVM](https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin-jvm) project.
To learn more about the game, **make sure to visit us at the JetBrains booth** during
the Kotlin Conf'24. Our team, including Gabriele Pappalardo, will be thrilled
to meet you and chat about what makes our game special.

In case you could not attend the conference, Gabriele can also be contacted at
[gabriele.pappalardo@jetbrains.com](mailto:gabriele.pappalardo@jetbrains.com)
