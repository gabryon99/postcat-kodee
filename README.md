## Kodee Delivery

### Abstract 

Kodee Delivery is a mobile 3D game written in Kotlin, using the Godot/Kotlin JVM bindings.

### Goals and Game

The goal of this game is to show how to create a simple game in Kotlin using the Godot bindings.
The game rules are quite easy. **Kodee** is our, beloved, cat-mascot of Kotlin. He is working as a delivery-cat,
and he must deliver all of his messages to the city mailboxes. However, due to his nature of being
a cat, Kodee is followed by the dog **Katcha**. Then, Kodee starts running while delivering mails.
Please help Kodee to survive from Katcha as long as you can.
