## Postcat Kodee

### Abstract and Synopsis

**Postcat Kodee** is a mobile 3D game written in Kotlin, using the [Godot/Kotlin JVM](https://godot-kotl.in/en/latest/) project.
The game can be played during the [KotlinConf'24](https://kotlinconf.com) to win an awesome gadget.

> Kodee is a post-cat in Denmark who loves his job. Each morning, he starts his day by doing his favorite thing: delivering messages. However, as is well-known, postmen, cats— moreover postcats —often face a common foe: dogs! In Kodee's world, these dogs are far from ordinary; they are made of... spaghetti code!? Thus, every morning, Kodee finds himself chased by a Spaghetti-Dog (name not final). Please help Kodee escape from the dog while safely delivering his precious mail!

The game can be exported to **Android** and **iOS** (through GraalVM).
